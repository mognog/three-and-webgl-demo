# Deployment and Optimization

## Deployment Methods
- Use **GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify** for easy hosting.
- Ensure all assets are **compressed and optimized** for performance.
- Implement **CDN hosting** where applicable.
- Set up **proper cache headers** for static assets.
- Configure **continuous deployment** pipelines.

## Production Optimization
- Minimize **file sizes using tree-shaking**.
- Implement **lazy loading** for assets where necessary.
- Enable **gzip or Brotli compression** to reduce load times.
- Ensure **security best practices** are followed for API calls.
- Add **source maps** for production debugging.
- Implement **feature flags** for gradual rollouts.
- Set up **error logging and monitoring** services.

## Graphics Asset Optimization
- **Pre-compile shaders** to improve initialization time.
- Use **simplified geometries** for better performance.
- Implement **level-of-detail (LOD)** systems for complex scenes.
- Add **asset preloading** for critical 3D resources.
- Use **texture atlases** to reduce texture switching.
- Implement **geometry instancing** for repeated objects.

## Runtime Performance Monitoring
- Add **FPS counters** to monitor rendering performance.
- Implement **memory usage tracking** for WebGL contexts.
- Create **performance markers** for critical rendering operations.
- Add **automatic quality adjustment** based on device capabilities.
- Implement **rendering throttling** for background tabs or low battery.

# Error Handling and Debugging

## Error Prevention
- Validate **user inputs** before processing.
- Add **type checking** with TypeScript or JSDoc.
- Use **defensive programming** techniques.

Related: See code-organization-and-workflow.md for code structure that minimizes errors.

## Error Handling
- Implement **try/catch blocks** for error-prone operations.
- Create **meaningful error messages** for users.
- Add **fallback UI states** when errors occur.

Related: See ai-integration-and-ux.md for handling AI service failures and rendering-performance-and-interaction.md for graphics error recovery.

## Debugging Tools
- Add **logging mechanisms** for important events.
- Implement **performance monitoring** tools.
- Create **debug modes** for development.

Related: See deployment-and-optimization.md for production monitoring and testing-and-quality-assurance.md for test-driven debugging.

## Graphics and Rendering Error Handling
- Add **WebGL capability detection** before attempting to initialize 3D contexts.
- Implement **graceful fallbacks** for when 3D rendering is not available.
- Use **debug objects** (like colored cubes or grid helpers) to verify rendering pipeline.
- Add **explicit error boundaries** around graphics initialization code.
- Include **detailed logging** for graphics context creation and scene setup.
- Implement **scene validation** to ensure all required elements are properly added.

## Structural Error Prevention
- **Validate file completeness** to prevent truncated JavaScript files.
- Ensure **proper bracket/parenthesis closure** in all code files.
- Add **syntax validation** in the build pipeline to catch syntax errors early.
- Implement **dependency checks** to ensure all required modules are available.
- Use **progressive enhancement** to ensure basic functionality works even if advanced features fail.

## Browser API Warnings and Optimizations
- Monitor console for **browser-specific warnings** about API usage patterns.
- Address **canvas performance warnings** by setting appropriate context attributes.
- Use **performance.mark()** and **performance.measure()** to identify slow operations.
- Implement **feature detection** for browser APIs before using them.
- Add **graceful degradation** for unsupported browser features.
- Create **automated warning detection** in development environments.

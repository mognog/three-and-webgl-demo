# Project Overview

## Purpose
This project is an **AI-powered interactive web demo**. AI suggestions should align with:
- **3D/2D graphics rendering** (WebGL, Canvas, or other libraries)
- **AI-generated content integration** (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)
- **User interactivity handling** (mouse, keyboard, or touch events)
- **Optimized performance and structured development**

AI should generate **performance-optimized** and **modular** code while following modern web development practices.

## Key Technologies (Subject to Change)
- **Graphics Library:** WebGL, Three.js, or other rendering solutions
- **UI Rendering:** HTML5 Canvas or DOM elements
- **AI API Integration:** OpenAI, Hugging Face, or custom models
- **Build Tool:** Vite (or similar)
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify

Related: For deployment details, see deployment-and-optimization.md.

## Core Features
✔ **Interactive scene rendering**  
✔ **AI-generated content displayed in UI**  
✔ **User interaction and real-time updates**  
✔ **Performance-optimized rendering**  
✔ **Deployable as a web-based application**

## Technical Considerations
- Follow **browser-recommended patterns** for performance-sensitive APIs.
- Address **console warnings** proactively during development.
- Implement **optimal context configurations** for Canvas and WebGL.
- Add **performance monitoring** for critical rendering operations.
- Create **consistent API usage patterns** across the codebase.
- Document **browser-specific optimizations** in code comments.

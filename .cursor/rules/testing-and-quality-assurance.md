# Testing and Quality Assurance

## Unit Testing
- Write **unit tests** for core functionality.
- Use **Jest or similar frameworks** for JavaScript testing.
- Implement **mock objects** for external dependencies.

Related: See code-organization-and-workflow.md for code structure that facilitates testing and error-handling-and-debugging.md for error cases to test.

## Integration Testing
- Test **component interactions** thoroughly.
- Verify **API integrations** work as expected.
- Test on **multiple browsers and devices**.

Related: See ai-integration-and-ux.md for AI API integration testing.

## Performance Testing
- Monitor **render times** and **frame rates**.
- Test with **different network conditions**.
- Benchmark **memory usage** during extended sessions.

Related: See rendering-performance-and-interaction.md for performance optimization techniques.

## Accessibility
- Ensure **keyboard navigation** works properly.
- Add **ARIA attributes** where appropriate.
- Test with **screen readers** and accessibility tools.

Related: See ai-integration-and-ux.md for accessibility considerations with AI-generated content.

## Graphics and Rendering Testing
- Add **visual regression tests** for 3D/2D rendering components.
- Implement **WebGL capability tests** in the CI pipeline.
- Create **performance benchmarks** for rendering operations.
- Test **initialization sequences** thoroughly to catch timing issues.
- Add **stress tests** that create and destroy many 3D objects.
- Implement **memory leak detection** for long-running graphics applications.

## Error Detection and Reporting
- Add **automated syntax checking** in the build process.
- Implement **runtime error boundaries** that catch and report rendering errors.
- Create **visual indicators** for when rendering components fail.
- Add **telemetry** for tracking rendering performance and errors in production.
- Test **recovery mechanisms** when graphics contexts are lost.

## Browser Console Monitoring
- Add **automated console warning detection** in testing environments.
- Create **tests that verify optimal API usage patterns** are followed.
- Implement **performance regression tests** for canvas and WebGL operations.
- Add **browser-specific test cases** for APIs with different implementations.
- Use **console mocking** to detect and fail tests when warnings occur.
- Create **visual performance monitors** that highlight slow operations.

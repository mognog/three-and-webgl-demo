# AI Integration and User Experience

## AI API Integration
- Use **AI-generated content** dynamically in the UI.
- Ensure **API calls are asynchronous** and handle errors properly.
- Cache AI responses where necessary to **reduce API usage**.
- Format and sanitize AI-generated outputs before rendering.
- **Implement fallback mechanisms** when AI services are unavailable.
- Add **loading states** during API calls to improve user experience.
- **Validate file names** against project conventions to prevent hard-to-spot errors.

## User Interaction Rules
- Ensure **real-time responsiveness** to user input.
- Use **natural language AI responses** to enhance engagement.
- Display AI-generated content using **intuitive UI elements**.
- Implement **context-aware AI updates** based on user interaction.
- Add **progressive enhancement** for different device capabilities.
- Include **accessibility features** for AI-generated content.

## Code Structure and Performance
- Maintain **strict separation of concerns** between AI, UI, and business logic.
- Keep files at a **manageable size** by breaking into smaller modules when appropriate.
- **Optimize AI processing** to run efficiently on available hardware.
- Implement **adaptive AI features** that scale based on device capabilities.
- Use **lazy loading** for AI models and non-critical AI features.
- Add **automated filename validation** in CI/CD pipelines to catch naming inconsistencies.

## Performance Considerations for AI Features
- Optimize **canvas operations** when processing images for AI analysis.
- Use **appropriate context attributes** (like willReadFrequently) for AI-related canvas operations.
- Implement **progressive loading** of AI features to improve perceived performance.
- Add **performance monitoring** specifically for AI-related operations.
- Create **fallback rendering modes** for devices with limited processing power.
- Implement **adaptive quality settings** based on device capabilities.
